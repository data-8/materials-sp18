We know that the German's warplanes are labeled consecutively from 1 to `N`, so `N` would be the total number of warplanes they ahve. \n",

In real life, if the RAF had known what the population looked like, they would have known `N` and would not have had any reason to think about random sampling.  They didn't know what the population looked like, so they couldn't have run the simulations we did.  So that was useful as an exercise in *understanding random variation* in an estimate, but not as a tool for practical data analysis.\n",

    "Welcome to the bonus question of lab07! Like other bonus questions, doing this problem won't count for or against you. It's just here for some extra practice if you would like some. At the Data 8 Annual Carnival Ring Toss game, you are given 100 rings per game. You will win the grand prize of a life-size Data 8 Bear if 60 rings out of 100 land on the bottles. As you might know, carnival owners purposely make the probability of you winning very small and sometimes it is almost impossible to win the cute life-size Data 8 Bear. Suppose for each ring, the probability of you landing it on the bottle is $.5$. How likely are you to win the grand prize?\n",

    "#### Question 4.1\n",
    "Use Chebyshev's bound to find out how likely it is for you to win the grand prize by landing 60 or more rings out of 100, with probability of you landing each ring on the bottle of .5. To refresh your memory, the Chebyshev's Ineuquality says that for all lists, and all numbers $z$ , the proportion of entries that are in the range \"average $z \\pm$ SDs\" is at least  $1− \\frac{1}{z^2}$. In mathematical form, the Chebyshev's Ineuquality can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P( \\mid Z - average \\mid \\geqslant z \\sigma) \\leq \\frac{1}{z^2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ring toss distribution can modeled as a distribution with P(ring landing on the bottle) = 1 and P(ring not landing on the bottle) = 0, each with probability 0.5. This distribution has an average of 50 and standard deviation of 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a function called `chebyshev_bound`.  It should take 1 argument which is the number of standard deviations away from the average, or `zSDs`. (For example, if our observed value is 10 standard deviations away from the average value, `zSDs` = 10.) It should return the maximum proportion of values greater than or equal to zSDs standard deviations away from the average given by the Chebyshev's Inequality. The code below provides an example use of your function and describes how you can verify that you've written it correctly.\n",
    "2. Set the result of `chebyshev_bound` with the appropriate `zSDs` that corresponds to landing 60 rings out of 100 to `chebyshev_upper_limit`."

    "As for your reference, the actual probability of you landing 60 or more rings on the bottle is $ \\binom{100}{60} .5^{60} * .5^{100-60}$ which is about $0.01$. It is important to note that Chebychev's Inequailty gives an upper bound, not an exact value or an approximation. What makes the result powerful is that it is true for all lists – all distributions, no matter how irregular. As we saw, the probability of winning in the range \"average $+2$ SDs\" under the simulations is quite a bit lower than the upper bound given by the Chebychev's Inequality. "
